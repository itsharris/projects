## 🔬 Featured Project
### [Bio-Inspired Micro Pin-Fin Heat Sinks](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2024.126581)
- Achieved **45% higher Nu** vs conventional designs using biomorphic geometries
- Developed ML models (XGBoost/RF) with **<3.5% MAPE** for thermal prediction
- Implemented agile manufacturing with 3D-printed test sections

```python
# Sample ML snippet from my research
from xgboost import XGBRegressor
model = XGBRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)  # Re=300-500, Pr=4-6
